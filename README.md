LASER (Lightweight Agent Spatial modeling for ERadication) is a framework for building agent-based infectious disease models with an emphasis on spatial modeling and efficient computation at scale.

[`laser-generic`](https://github.com/laser-base/laser-generic) builds on top of [`laser-core`](https://github.com/laser-base/laser-core), offering a set of ready-to-use, generic disease model components (e.g., SI, SIS, SIR dynamics, births, deaths, vaccination).

## Getting Started and Documentation

We recommend using the [LASER documentation](https://laser.idmod.org/laser-generic) to familiarize yourself with the LASER disease modeling framework. However, the instructions below may be sufficient for those who want to jump right in.

### Installation

We recommend using [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) for faster, more reliable installs:

```
uv pip install laser-generic
```

Alternatively, you can use regular `pip`:

```
pip install laser-generic
```

To install the latest in-development version:

```
pip install https://github.com/laser-core/laser-generic/archive/main.zip
```

#### Using `laser-generic`

`laser-generic` can be used in your code after importing it into your project:

```python
import laser.generic as lg

print(lg.__version__)
```

### Development

1. clone the `laser-generic` repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/laser-base/laser-generic.git
```

2. install [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) _in your system [Python], i.e., _before_ creating and activating a virtual environment

3. install `tox` as a tool in `uv` with the `tox-uv` plugin with

```bash
uv tool install tox --with tox-uv
```

4. change to the `laser-generic` directoryh with

```bash
cd laser-generic
```

5. create a virtual environment for development with

```bash
uv venv .venv
```

6. activate the virtual environment with

**Mac or Linux:**

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows:**

```sh
.venv\bin\Activate
```

#### Building Code in Development

**Option 1: build "live" code** - Python scripts using `laser.generic` will import the code directly from the repository clone. Edits to the source code will take effect upon restarting the Python environment and importing `laser.generic`.

with `pip`:

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

**Option 2: build an installable package** - this package must be installed into an environment to be used and changes to the source code on disk will not be picked up by consumers of `laser.generic` until the package is rebuilt and reinstalled. However this process mirrors using `laser.generic` as a dependency better than the "live code" option above.

**Option 2A: build with `pip`**

- install the `build` package: `python3 -m pip install build`
- build the `laser-generic` Python packge: `python3 -m build`
- find the wheel file, `.whl`, in the `dist` directory: `ls -l dist`

**Option 2B: build with `uv`**

- `uv build`
- find the wheel file, `.whl`, in the `dist` directory: `ls -l dist`

#### Running Tests

Now you can run tests in the `tests` directory or run the entire check+docs+test suite with ```tox```. Running ```tox``` will run several consistency checks, build documentation, run tests against the supported versions of Python, and create a code coverage report based on the test suite. Note that the first run of ```tox``` may take a few minutes (~5). Subsequent runs should be quicker depending on the speed of your machine and the test suite (~2 minutes). You can use ```tox``` to run tests against a single version of Python with, for example, ```tox -e py312```.
