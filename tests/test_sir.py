        Feature: Pure SIR epidemic on a 1-D linear chain (no births/deaths)
        -------------------------------------------------------------------
        This test validates the core SIR epidemic logic in LASER without
        the added complexity of demographic processes. It uses a one-dimensional
        spatial chain of patches and checks that the SIR transmission,
        infectious-period progression, and recovery transitions behave
        correctly in a fixed-population setting.

        Model structure:
            • 1×N linear chain topology (each patch has at most two neighbors).
            • SIR disease dynamics:
                  S → I → R
              with user-specified infectious-duration distribution.
            • No vital dynamics: total population remains fixed.
            • Initial seeding: low-level infection at one end of the chain.
            • Simulation runs for 365 ticks.

        What this test verifies:
            ✓ Population conservation: S + I + R remains constant at all times.
            ✓ Epidemic growth: infection increases substantially from the initial seed.
            ✓ Epidemic peak: I(t) achieves a clear maximum mid-simulation.
            ✓ Epidemic decline: I(t) falls significantly after the peak (R buildup).
            ✓ Realistic attack fraction: final R/N is in a plausible SIR range.
            ✓ Numerical stability: no negative states or invalid transitions.

        Why this test matters:
            This is the simplest fully functional SIR validation scenario.
            It isolates the epidemic engine—transmission, timers, and recovery—
            from demographic noise. Passing this test demonstrates that LASER’s
            SIR core mechanics work correctly before layering on births/mortality.

        Feature: SIR epidemic on a 1-D linear chain with demographic turnover
        ---------------------------------------------------------------------
        This test validates the correct integration of SIR epidemic dynamics
        with demographic processes (births and mortality) in a minimal spatial
        topology. Unlike the pure-epidemic test, new susceptibles enter the
        population through births and individuals are removed by mortality.
        This produces a continuously shifting demographic structure and a
        more complex epidemic trajectory.

        Model structure:
            • 1×N linear chain topology (nearest-neighbor mixing).
            • SIR disease dynamics with finite infectious periods.
            • Vital dynamics:
                  – Births via BirthsByCBR (per-node crude birth rate).
                  – Mortality via Kaplan–Meier survival curve.
              These cause population turnover and susceptible replenishment.
            • Simulation runs for 365 ticks.

        What this test verifies:
            ✓ Population drift remains moderate (< ~15%) despite births/mortality.
            ✓ Epidemic growth occurs and produces a substantial peak.
            ✓ Decline after peak still occurs (though muted by new susceptibles).
            ✓ Population never becomes negative or unstable.
            ✓ Birth/death accounting remains reasonable (no runaway imbalance).
            ✓ SIR and demographic components interact consistently across time.

        Why this test matters:
            This scenario checks LASER’s ability to combine SIR infection
            progression with realistic demographic churn. It validates that
            births replenish susceptibles correctly, mortality removes agents
            without destabilizing dynamics, and that the combined system
            behaves plausibly and numerically stably.

            Passing this test gives confidence that LASER’s SIR implementation
            works not only in fixed-population settings, but also in models
            where demographic forces shape long-term epidemic patterns.
