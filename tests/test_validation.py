Validation tests for LASER generic model components.

This test suite validates that all components properly execute their validation
functions when model.validating = True. Tests verify that validation hooks
(prevalidate_step and postvalidate_step) are called and can detect inconsistencies.

Components tested:
- components.py: All transmission and disease state components
- vitaldynamics.py: Birth and mortality components
- immunization.py: Immunization components (NOTE: missing validation infrastructure)
- importation.py: Importation components (NOTE: missing validation infrastructure)
